# Solana_NFT_Staking
Lame attempt at learning Solana Developing. Probably doesn't work.


`REWLYBz1rZFS2ErKB5LEdXTYChUXBAvF2zjbizsAsjM.json` = Devnet reward token (deployed)

`test_staking.json` = keypair I used to deploy the program to devnet 

My `solana config get` looks like this:
```
Config File: $HOME/.config/solana/cli/config.yml
RPC URL: https://api.devnet.solana.com 
WebSocket URL: wss://api.devnet.solana.com/ (computed)
Keypair Path: test_staking.json 
Commitment: confirmed 
```
